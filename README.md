# Work-Day-Scheduler
work day scheduler allows you to imput tasks or whatever it is that you have going of for the day. the red tells you that the imput in the current time block is currently supposed to be happening and the green is for scheduled events later in the day. once you finish typing in your event, you can hit the saave button and it will save it to the local storage.
